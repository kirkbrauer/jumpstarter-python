# Jumpstarter Configuration

Jumpstarter can be configured as either a client, an exporter, or both depending on your use case and deployment strategy.

By default, a local client and exporter session are automatically initalized when running test scripts through `jmp start` or the `jmp shell` commands. This allows for easy testing of new drivers, client libraries, or verifying that tests work on your local bench.

When interacting with remote exporters in a CLI or CI environment, multiple clients can be configured on the same system and used to interact with different devices and different exporter instances.

Similarly, multiple exporters can be configured on a single host system to interact with many different devices. However, each exporter instance is independent, making it possible to stop, restart, and add new exporters while others are executing tests.

## Clients

Client configurations are stored in the Jumpstarter user configuration directory `~/.config/jumpstarter`. Each client config is a YAML file that contains the client name, access token, and any configuration parameters.

### Client Config

```yaml
# ~/.config/jumpstarter/clients/myclient.yaml

apiVersion: jumpstarter.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Client
metadata:
  name: myclient
client:
  endpoint: "grpcs://jumpstarter.my-lab.com:1443"
  token: "dGhpc2lzYXRva2VuLTEyMzQxMjM0MTIzNDEyMzQtc2Rxd3Jxd2VycXdlcnF3ZXJxd2VyLTEyMzQxMjM0MTIzNDEyMzQxMjM0LXF3ZXJxd2VycXdlcnF3ZXJxd2VycXdlcnF3ZXIK"
  drivers:
    # Wildcards are supported
    allow: ["jumpstarter.drivers.*", "vendorpackage.*"]
```

- `endpoint` - The gRPC endpoint of the Jumpstarter controller server.
- `token` - A client auth token generated by the controller.
- `drivers` - Driver client library configuration.
    - `allow` - A list of allowed driver namespaces to automatically load.
    - `unsafe: true` - Should all drivers be allowed to load?

### Multiple Clients

Multiple client configs can be added to the `~/.config/jumpstarter/clients` directory manually or by using the Jumpstarter CLI.

Similar to kubectl, Jumpstarter allows you to switch between different client configurations using the CLI tool. A `default` client is automatically configured when installing the Jumpstarter Helm chart with `jmp install`. 

### CLI Commands

To create a new client, the `jmp client create <name>` command can be used. When `kubectl` is installed and the current context contains a Jumpstarter controller instance, client tokens will be automatically generated using the controller endpoint.

```bash
$ jmp client create myclient
Using kubectl context 'my-cluster'
Generating client auth token
Created client config '/home/jdoe/.config/jumpstarter/clients/myclient.yaml'
```

To switch between different client configs, use the `jmp client use <name>` command:

```bash
$ jmp client use another
Using client config '/home/jdoe/.config/jumpstarter/clients/another.yaml'
```

All client configurations can be listed with `jmp client list`:

```bash
$ jmp client list
CURRENT   NAME       ENDPOINT                               LOCATION
*         default    grpcs://jumpstarter1.my-lab.com:1443   /home/jdoe/.config/jumpstarter/clients/default.yaml
          myclient   grpcs://jumpstarter2.my-lab.com:1443   /home/jdoe/.config/jumpstarter/clients/myclient.yaml
          another    grpcs://jumpstarter3.my-lab.com:1443   /home/jdoe/.config/jumpstarter/clients/another.yaml
```

Clients can also be removed using `jmp client delete <name>`:

```bash
$ jmp client delete myclient
Deleted client config '/home/jdoe/.config/jumpstarter/clients/myclient.yaml'
```

### Environment Variables

The client configuration may also be provided by environment variables which may be useful in CI or when writing a script that uses Jumpstarter.

- `JUMPSTARTER_CLIENT_CONFIG` - A path to a client configuration YAML file to use.
- `JUMPSTARTER_CLIENT` - The name of a registered client config to use.
- `JUMPSTARTER_ENDPOINT` - The gRPC endpoint of the Jumpstarter controller server (overrides the config value).
- `JUMPSTARTER_TOKEN` - A client auth token generated by the controller (overrides the config value).
- `JUMPSTARTER_DRIVERS` - A comma-separated list of allowed driver namespaces to automatically load (overrides the config value).

## Exporters

Exporter configurations are by default stored globally in the Jumpstarter config directory `/etc/jumpstarter`. Each exporter config is a YAML file and optionally a Python script to initalize the exporter and its associated drivers.

### Exporter Config

Exporters can be configured using a pure-YAML format, which allows for the configuration of built-in drivers and any additional driver packages registered by the user.

```yaml
# /etc/jumpstarter/myexporter.yaml

apiVersion: jumpstarter.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Exporter
metadata:
  name: myexporter
exporter:
  endpoint: "grpcs://jumpstarter.my-lab.com:1443"
  token: "dGhpc2lzYXRva2VuLTEyMzQxMjM0MTIzNDEyMzQtc2Rxd3Jxd2VycXdlcnF3ZXJxd2VyLTEyMzQxMjM0MTIzNDEyMzQxMjM0LXF3ZXJxd2VycXdlcnF3ZXJxd2VycXdlcnF3ZXIK"
  drivers:
    import: ["jumpstarter.drivers.*", "vendorpackage.*"]
    root:
      type: "jumpstarter.drivers.composite.Composite"
      children:
        - name: power
          type: "jumpstarter.drivers.power.PduPower"
          config:
            host: "192.168.1.111"
            port: 1234
            username: "admin"
            password: "secret"
        - name: serial
          type: "jumpstarter.drivers.power.PduPower"
          config:
            type: "jumpstarter.drivers.serial.Pyserial"
            port: "/dev/ttyUSB0"
            baudrate: 115200
        - name: custom
          type: "vendorpackage.CustomDriver"
          config:
            hello: "world"
```

- `endpoint` - The gRPC endpoint of the Jumpstarter controller server.
- `token` - An exporter auth token generated by the controller.
- `drivers` - Exporter driver configuration.
  - `import` - Specific driver namespaces to import (if not using a setup script).
  - `allow` - A list of allowed driver namespaces to automatically load (required with setup script).
  - `root` - The root driver config (not used if using setup script).
  - `script` - The path to a setup script to run to configure the drivers.
  - `unsafe: true` - Should all drivers be allowed to load?

For more complex configuration or auto-discovery, a custom Python setup script may be necassary:

```yaml
# /etc/jumpstarter/exporters/myexporter/exporter.yaml

apiVersion: jumpstarter.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Exporter
metadata:
  name: myexporter
exporter:
  endpoint: "grpcs://jumpstarter.my-lab.com:1443"
  token: "dGhpc2lzYXRva2VuLTEyMzQxMjM0MTIzNDEyMzQtc2Rxd3Jxd2VycXdlcnF3ZXJxd2VyLTEyMzQxMjM0MTIzNDEyMzQxMjM0LXF3ZXJxd2VycXdlcnF3ZXJxd2VycXdlcnF3ZXIK"
  drivers:
    allow: ["jumpstarter.drivers.*", "vendorpackage.*"]
    script: ./setup.py
```

```python
# /etc/jumpstarter/exporter/myexporter/setup.py

from jumpstarter.drivers.power import PduPower
from jumpstarter.drivers.serial import PySerial
from jumpstarter.drivers.composite import Composite
from jumpstarter.drivers import from_yaml
from serial import Serial

# Custom Python logic
serial = Serial(port="/dev/ttyUSB0", baudrate=115200)

def setup():
    return Composite(
        name="root",
        children=[
            PduPower(
                name="power",
                host="192.168.1.111",
                port=1234,
                username="admin",
                password="secret",
            ),
            PySerial(name="serial", serial=serial),
        ],
    )
```

Exporters can be discovered within the `/etc/jumpstarter/exporters` directory either as a single YAML file or as a directory containing an `exporter.yaml` file.

### CLI Commands

To create a new exporter, the `jmp exporter create <name>` command can be used. When `kubectl` is installed and the current context contains a Jumpstarter controller instance, exporter tokens will be automatically generated using the controller endpoint. By default, a basic YAML config will be generated.

```bash
$ jmp exporter create myexporter
Using kubectl context 'my-cluster'
Generating exporter auth token
Created exporter config '/etc/jumpstarter/exporters/myexporter.yaml'
```

To generate an exporter config with a custom setup script:

```bash
$ jmp exporter create myexporter --custom
Using kubectl context 'my-cluster'
Generating exporter auth token
Created exporter config '/etc/jumpstarter/exporters/myexporter/exporter.yaml'
Created exporter setup script '/etc/jumpstarter/exporters/myexporter/setup.py'
```

To use a specific config when starting the exporter:

```bash
$ jmp exporter start another
Using exporter config '/etc/jumpstarter/exporters/another/exporter.yaml'
```

The path to a config can also be defined:

```bash
$ jmp exporter start --config /etc/jumpstarter/exporters/another/exporter.yaml
```

All exporter configurations can be listed with `jmp exporter list`:

```bash
$ jmp exporter list
NAME         ENDPOINT                               LOCATION                                           SCRIPT
default      grpcs://jumpstarter1.my-lab.com:1443   /etc/jumpstarter/exporters/default.yaml            N/A
myexporter   grpcs://jumpstarter2.my-lab.com:1443   /etc/jumpstarter/exporters/myexporter.yaml         N/A
another      grpcs://jumpstarter3.my-lab.com:1443   /etc/jumpstarter/exporters/another/exporter.yaml   /etc/jumpstarter/exporters/another/setup.py
```

Clients can also be removed using `jmp client delete <name>`:

```bash
$ jmp client delete myexporter
Deleted exporter config '/etc/jumpstarter/exporters/myexporter.yaml'
```

### Environment Variables

The exporter configuration may also be provided by environment variables which may be useful in CI or when writing a script that uses Jumpstarter.

- `JUMPSTARTER_EXPORTER_CONFIG` - A path to a exporter configuration YAML file to use.
- `JUMPSTARTER_EXPORTER` - The name of a registered exporter config to use.
- `JUMPSTARTER_ENDPOINT` - The gRPC endpoint of the Jumpstarter controller server (overrides the config value).
- `JUMPSTARTER_TOKEN` - An exporter auth token generated by the controller (overrides the config value).
- `JUMPSTARTER_DRIVERS` - A comma-separated list of allowed driver namespaces to automatically load (overrides the config value).
